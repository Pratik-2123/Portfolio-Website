export const HERO_CONTENT = `At 19, I'm all about tech â€“ it's my playground and my passion. I'm a natural learner, so diving into new coding languages is like cracking open a good mystery novel. Web development was my first conquest, and I've built some projects I'm pretty proud of.Now, I'm obsessed with Android development. The challenge of crafting intuitive apps for people to use every day is super exciting, and my learning curve is practically vertical. Give me a coding problem, and I'll be itching to solve it with an innovative approach!`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm a highly motivated student with a strong foundation in Java and a passion for exploring new technologies. In addition to Java, I've delved into C, C++, and Python, further expanding my programming skillset..


I'm also eager to learn the ropes of app development. I've recently gained experience with design tools like Figma, particularly focusing on prototyping, and have been actively learning Android development using Kotlin.


My passion for innovation extends beyond the classroom. Participating in hackathons like the New India Vibrant Hackathon 2023 and the Accenture Innovation Challenge 2023 has not only honed my leadership and teamwork skills, but has also led me to win several hackathons! I even represented my team in the finals of the prestigious HACK-Ai competition held by IIT Bombay.


Beyond software development, I find enjoyment in playing sports. This not only reflects my dedication but also highlights my ability to work effectively within a team.`;
